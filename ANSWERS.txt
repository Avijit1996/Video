1. What's your favourite state management library for react and why?
Answer.
My favourite state management library is Redux.
Redux is undoubtedly a very powerful tool to 
manage the states of an application and more control
over data.Although it has great documentation,
Its large community makes it easier to 
understand more clearly.



2. Write some react native best practices.
Answer. 
1)Use Functional Component For Stateless Presentational Component.
2) Use Class Component For Stateful Container Component.
3) Key Of Each Element In List Should Be Unique.
4) Use Redux.js for managing States and Business Logic.
5) Lock Dependencies, Prevent The Breaking Changes.


3. Which coding style you prefer wet or dry and why?
Answer.
My prefer coding style is dry.
The biggest benefit of using DRY is maintainability.
If the logic of checking permissions was repeated 
all over the code, it becomes difficult to fix issues 
that arise in the repeated code. When you fix a problem 
in one, you could easily forget to fix the problem 
in other occurrences.



4. What do you prefer expo or vanilla react native and why?
Answer.
vanilla because I can add native modules written in Objective-C, 
Java, Kotlin,and packages that require linking.
I can decide by Myself what React Native version to use.
